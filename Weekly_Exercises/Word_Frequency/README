Weekly Exercise #3: Word Frequency

Running Instructions:
	1. Open a terminal on Linux and change the directory to the one
	containing the "freq.py" file.
	2. Run the following command: "python3 freq.py <input_file_name>".
	3. Here, <input_file_name> should be replaced with the name of the
	file containing the inputs that the program will read from.

Assumptions:
	1. The input file will always be located in the same directory as
	freq.py.
	2. The input file will always be in plaintext.
	3. The output file destination will be either empty or does not exist
	when the program beings to run.
	4. The filename will be a string. The program was not created to
	check if the filename is a string.

Notes:
	1. The program will present an error message if the filename does not
	exist in the current directory.
	2. The program will present an error message if the input file does
	not contain any words, and no output file will be created.
	3. The program will overwrite the contents of <input_file_name>.out if
	it already exists in the current directory.
	4. The output file will be in plaintext, and the frequency table will
	be written in lexicographic order by the unique words found in the
	input file.
	5. The relative frequency will be a number in the range [0,1] that is
	the ratio of the count for the word to the total number of words found
	in the input file. The relative frequency is rounded to 3 decimal 
	places using the round() function.
