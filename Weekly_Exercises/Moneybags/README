Weekly Exercise #7: Dr. Moneybags

Running Instructions:
	1. Open a terminal on Linux and change the directory to the one
	containing the "moneybags.py" file.
	2. The program can be run in the following ways:
		a) Enter the following command:
			"python3 moneybags.py".
		In this way, the program takes standard input.
		b) Enter the following command:
			"python3 moneybags.py < input_file_name > output_file_name"
		This way is using I/O redirection and printing the output of the
		moneybags.py file to the "output_file_name" file. Here, the
		"input_file_name" file must be in the same directory as the
		moneybags.py file.
		c) Enter the following command:
			"./opentestcenter.sh"
		Click "Run" -> "Run all" in the Test Center application window to
		run all the tests.

Assumptions:
	1. The moneybags.py program was written to run in O(nlog(n)) time.
	2. The user enters a single integer n (0 <= n < = 100000), where n is
	the number of applicants to the club. For the next n lines that
	follow, the user enters a single integer w (0 <= w < = 1000000000),
	that represent's the net worth of an applicant, in millions of dollars.
	The program was not created to handle unexpected data type inputs for
	the two cases of inputs as stated previously.
	3. The get_threshold() function will return a 0 for the minimum
	millions of dollars required for an applicant to join Dr. Moneybag's
	elite club if there are zero applicants, or all the applicants have a
	net worth of zero millions of dollars.

Notes:
	1. The list comprehension used in get_input() function to obtain the
	net worth of all the applicants would have a time complexity of O(n).
	2. The sort() function used in get_input() function to sort the list
	of the net worth of all the applicants in ascending order would have
	an average and worst case time complexity of O(nlog(n)).
	3. The single for loop used in get_threshold() function to iterate for
	the number of applicants would have a worst case time complexity of
	O(n).
	4. A main() function was created to call get_input() and
	get_threshold() functions in order to modularize the code.
